# SharepointTools

--- Import Terms and Synonyms ---
Powershell script that imports Terms and Other Labels (Synonyms) from a CSV file to Sharepoint Online. Try the 'No Delay' version of the script first, if there are errors try the delayed version as it works more reliably but slower. CSV formatting is shown in the GUI - you must follow this formatting exactly for the script to work. You can have an unlimited amount of L1Ts and Other Labels.
